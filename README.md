# Botanical_Iris_Classification-
 Created Iris flower classification project using Python, scikit-learn, and algorithms like Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, and Logistic Regression to classify Iris species by petal and sepal measurements
# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the application of machine learning with Python programming for Iris flower classification. We use scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library, to implement various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The primary goal is to classify different species of Iris flowers and measure the accuracy of the models.

## Algorithms Used

- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Train-Test Split**

## Project Description

In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to categorize Iris flowers into their respective species based on their unique characteristics. The Iris dataset is a classic example for beginners, as it provides a straightforward introduction to machine learning concepts.

This project is especially designed to be beginner-friendly and comprehensible for those new to machine learning. It aims to demonstrate the practical application of machine learning for solving real-world problems.

## Usage

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries (scikit-learn, numpy, etc.) installed. You can install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- **Data**: The Iris dataset is included in the project. You can also access it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

- **Code**: The project code is available in both Jupyter Notebook (`iris_classification.ipynb`) and Python script (`iris_classification.py`) formats.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to explore the machine learning algorithms and their performance on the Iris dataset.

## Contributions

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome. If you find any issues or want to improve the project, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the UCI Machine Learning Repository for providing the Iris dataset, making it accessible for educational purposes.
